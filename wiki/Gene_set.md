>> Users can add new gene sets in the "Add a Gene Set" section. Please note that users **cannot break lines in any text boxes** — entering multiple lines will result in only the first line being saved to the database.
>> - Geneset name: Name of the custom gene set. Later on, the user will use this name to select the gene set.
>> - Genes: The genes that you want to use in the custom gene set. Each gene should be written line by line. Currently, listing gene symbols is recommended rather than using others, such as Ensembl IDs.
>> - Cell line/Cell type: (optional) From which cells is the gene set defined?
>> - Data source: (optional) From which resource/experiment is the gene set coming?
>> - Description: (optional) How the user obtained the gene set and how the gene set was defined.
>>
>> Click "Add the geneset to the list", and the user can see the newly added gene set at the top of the table.

>> The registered gene sets can be edited at any time in the "Custom Gene Sets" table. Each cell is editable by double-clicking. After making an edit, the changes will appear below the table. The edit is saved when you click "Save changes" and see the confirmation message "saved!" You can select rows by clicking them (multiple selections are possible), and the number of selected rows appears at the bottom of the table. Clicking "Delete selected data" removes all selected rows from the database.
